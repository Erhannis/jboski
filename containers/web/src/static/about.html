        <p>This site gives a visual representation of
        <a href="https://www.lojban.org">Lojban</a> language text as
        parsed by <a href="https://mw.lojban.org/papri/la_jbofi%27e">the jbofihe parser</a>.</p>
        <p>This site's code <a href="https://github.com/lojban/jboski">is on GitHub</a>.</p>
        <p>This program was originally PHP and hosted at https://lojban.org/jboski/index.php ; you can <a href="https://lojban.org/jboski/index.php.txt">see the source</a>.  The original version was by RaphaÃ«l Poss / r.poss [at] online.fr</p>
        <p>There is <a href="https://camxes.lojban.org/">a similar parser that uses the newer camxes</a>.  It is much prettier but it does not show a partial translation.<p>
        <p>There is <a href="http://masatohagiwara.net/camxes.js/">a parser that uses a JS version of camxes</a>, but its output is not as pretty.<p>
